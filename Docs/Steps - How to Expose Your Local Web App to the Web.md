# Steps - How to Expose Your Local Web App to the Web

## 1. Create a tunnel to your local web app. Run:

```powershell
    npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain sunvoy
```

## 2. It will give you a url to your web app similar to this. Click on the link:

```
    your url is: https://sunvoy.loca.lt
```

## 3. It will then either ask for your tunnel password or give you access to the app and load it in the browser. If it asks for your tunnel password and you don't know it, you can browse this link to get it:

```
    https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword
```

## 4. It will give you an IP Address like value. Use it as your tunnel password.

Example:
```
    135.159.45.6
```

After that you can now access the web app and browse it in your local browser
